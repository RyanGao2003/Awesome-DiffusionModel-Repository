## Diffusion-Learning-Repository

Here's some recent papers about diffusion (models) learning published since 2022. Data is collected form IEEE Xplore.

The diffusion method can be summarized as follows:

**\*…systematically and slowly destroy the structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models …\***

_–_ _Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics, 2015_

Basically, the Diffusion Models work by continuously adding Gaussian noise to destroy the training data, and then learning to recover the data by reversing this noise process.

We divide these papers into four categories, including **Computer Vision**, **Temporal Data Modeling**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Theory**.
